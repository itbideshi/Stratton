                    <p>If we successfully obtain the finance you require, you must pay us a fee for our services when the finance is settled.  This administration fee is the only fee we charge you and may be included in the financed amount or can be paid directly to us. 
As we use a range of lenders, the maximum fee we may charge you is dependent on the specific lender that provides your finance. 
Ordinarily, the maximum fee we may charge for our services is $990.00 (including GST). In the event that you obtain finance through RateSetter Australia RE Limited, the maximum we may charge for our services is $1,500.00 (including GST). These fees are maximum possible fees, and the exact amount you need to pay will be fully disclosed on any loan contract before you sign and accept the loan offer. 
You do not have to pay us any other fees and charges for assisting you source finance. However, you may be required to pay fees to the financier.</p>
